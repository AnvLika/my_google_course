we have 2 files : file1 and file2 they have difference in one line.

to check what is different : diff -u  file1.py file2.py
to save this difference of file1 compare to file2:  diff -u  file1.py file2.py > change.diff
to apply changes(the difference)  to the file1 to fix an issue we need : pathc file1.py < change.diff



to open any file: vim change.diff
to change : i
to save: :w - write (save) the file, but don't exit
:wq or :x or ZZ - write (save) and quit

here is the chit list:    https://vim.rtorr.com/


to run the puthon code use : python -i file1_fix.py
to exit execution of the python code type "exit"
